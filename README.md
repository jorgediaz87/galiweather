## Weather forecast data for Galicia

The Galiweather project seeks to provide both weather forecasting and historical data comparison.

## Features

- REST API based system.

## Tech

Galiweather uses a number of open source projects to work properly:

- [Laravel Framework] - API Rest Backend

And of course Galiweather itself is open source with a on GitHub.
